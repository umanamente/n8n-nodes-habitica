## Credentials

This node uses Habitica API credentials: **User ID** and **API Token**. 

You can find the credentials in the [Habitica settings](https://habitica.com/user/settings/api).

### Executing arbitrary Habitica API requests

You can use your N8N Habitica credentials with **"HTTP Request"** node to execute arbitrary Habitica API requests.

1. Add "HTTP Request" node to your workflow.
2. Select appropriate method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) in the "Method" field.
3. Enter the URL of the Habitica API endpoint you want to use (e.g. `https://habitica.com/api/v3/tasks/user` to get all user tasks).
4. In "Authentication" select your existing Habitica credentials.
5. (Optional) Use `Send Query Parameters` and `Send Body` fields if needed by the API method you are using.

> Note: Use appropriate HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for your request. It is specified in the [Habitica API documentation](https://habitica.com/apidoc/).
